- âš¡ Fun fact:  The term "bug" in computer science originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped the moth into the computer's logbook with the annotation: "First actual case of bug being found." Since then, "debugging" has been the term used for fixing errors in code.
